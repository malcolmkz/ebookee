# Ebookee

Ebookee is an awesome cloud ebooks management app. It support storing your favorite epub ebooks on the cloud so that you can access them anytime you want.
The app allows adding, deleting and updating ebooks.

For testing purposes you can download some free (and legal) ebooks from the Gutenberg project website : https://www.gutenberg.org/, and if you are a fun of Sherlock Holmes, you will find two great books in the ebooks folder.

Have fun and enjoy your ebooks :-)

# Testing the app
The app is composed of a backend and a frontend. 
The backend contains lambda functions that implement the ebooks APIs.
The frontend is developed in REACT.

To test the app please run the frontend locally. All lambda functions are running, so you will not face any issues connecting to the API.
